# Black_groundcolourChanger
This interactive web page allows users to change the background color of the entire page by clicking on vibrant, animated color buttons. It's a fun and visually engaging way to demonstrate basic DOM manipulation using JavaScript, combined with stylish CSS transitions and hover effects.

âœ¨ Features
- Color Buttons: Four clickable buttons (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow), each styled as colorful squares with rounded corners.
- Smooth Transitions: The background color of the page changes smoothly with a fade effect, thanks to CSS transitions.
- Dynamic Hover Effects: Buttons enlarge, tilt, and glow when hovered over, creating a playful and responsive feel.
- Responsive Layout: The page is centered both vertically and horizontally, making it look great on any screen size.
- Clean Typography: Uses modern fonts and spacing for a polished appearance.

This project is perfect for beginners who want to learn:
- How to use querySelectorAll and addEventListener in JavaScript
